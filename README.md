 ## Problem

Build a gaming app and come up with the design for a flask application. The design should include the html files needed for the application along with different routes.

## Solution

The following is a design for a flask application that can be used to build a gaming app. The application includes the following HTML files:

* `index.html`: This is the main page of the application. It includes a login form and a link to the game page.
* `game.html`: This page displays the game. It includes a canvas element where the game is rendered, as well as a control panel that allows the user to control the game.
* `login.html`: This page allows the user to login to the application. It includes a login form and a link to the main page.

The application also includes the following routes:

* `/`: This route displays the main page of the application.
* `/game`: This route displays the game page.
* `/login`: This route displays the login page.

The following is a diagram of the application's architecture:

## Implementation

The following is a sample implementation of the application in Python using Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/game')
def game():
    return render_template('game.html')

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return render_template('login.html')
    else:
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        if username == 'admin' and password == 'secret':
            return redirect(url_for('index'))
        else:
            return render_template('login.html', error='Invalid credentials')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Testing

The application can be tested by running the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The application can then be accessed by visiting the following URL:

```
http://localhost:5000
```
